Middor is a free and open-source Android application for mirroring apps on your device.

With built-in support for horizontal flip and 180° rotation, Middor can be used to:

<ul>
  <li>Display apps on a HUD</li>
  <li>Project content onto a car windscreen (e.g. Google Maps navigation)</li>
  <li>View mirrored images and videos</li>
</ul>

Middor only supports devices running Android 14 QPR2 or higher, as it relies on the single app screen sharing feature. For more details, see Android 14 - App Screen Sharing: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/features/app-screen-sharing
