Middor is a free and open-source Android application for mirroring apps on your device.

With built-in support for horizontal flip and 180° rotation, Middor can be used to:

- Display apps on a HUD
- Project content onto a car windscreen (e.g. Google Maps navigation)
- View mirrored images and videos

Middor only supports devices running Android 14 or higher (SDK 34+), as it relies on the single app screen sharing feature. For more details, see Android 14 - App Screen Sharing: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/features/app-screen-sharing

For usage instructions, see https://github.com/nktnet1/middor/discussions/2
